# Webpack
Webpack is a "bundler," which means it combines all your code and assets into a smaller number of files, making your application more efficient and faster to load in the browser.

Developers usually don't configure Webpack directly. Instead, they use tools like create-react-app or Next.js that handle it behind the scenes. However, it's still good to know how Webpack works and how it fits with other tools like Babel and Prettier.

Babel is a transpiler, meaning it converts modern JavaScript code into a version that browsers can understand. It processes files one by one, but this isn't very efficient for large projects, as it would produce too many files. That's where Webpack comes in. Webpack packages all the JavaScript files into a smaller number of bundles, making it much faster for browsers to download and process them.

Webpack is like the conductor of an orchestra, using tools like Babel and Prettier to process the files as it bundles them. It also optimizes the code, deciding what should be included in common bundles and what should be in single-use files.

Webpack also allows you to import non-JavaScript assets like images, CSS files, and SVGs, treating them as if they were JavaScript modules. This is possible because Webpack manages the entire build process and can optimize how these assets are handled.

In the example provided, an image is imported and used in a React component. This code wouldn't work directly in the browser, but with Webpack, the image import is transformed into a standard variable pointing to the image's location. This allows Webpack to optimize the handling of the image and improve the application's performance:

```jsx
import catSrc from '../../assets/cat.jpg';

function CatAvatar() {
  return (
    <img
      alt="Cute cat sitting in a chair like a person"
      src={catSrc}
    />
  );
}
```
